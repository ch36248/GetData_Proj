* It is designed to be run from a working folder which also contains the UCI HAR Dataset folder
* Produces a space-delimited output text file (including column headers) called "X_all_mean_std_avg.txt"
* Recommended command for reading text file back in: read.table("X_all_mean_std_avg.txt", header=TRUE)
